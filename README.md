# Flavor Harmony

This project is designed as an opportunity to play with a variety of technologies while trying to solve a key issue in my daily life: planning meals with my partner.

## Project Status

This project is currently in its initial stages. [Requirements are being laid out](#project-requirements) and parts of the stack are still being learned.

## Project Requirements + Reaches
1. Allow a group of 2 or more people to view and modify a plan together.
2. Plans can encompass multiple meals with a schedule or be planned as single items, as well.
3. Users should be able to generate a grocery list based on the meals listed: they can upload a reciple, or we will use our bank of recipes to create a suggested grocery list for them.
4. Plans can be recurring: ie; when it is time to plan meals again, an event and a link is created and the users can go and build another list.
5. A pre-populated set of items is allowed.
6. A "mediator tool" creates suggestions for the users if there is a need, ie; when there is a dispute on meals or the user is unsure as to what to bring, say, to a pot-luck.
7. Plans are exportable in a variety of formats.
8. Dietary restrictions or preferences are accounted for (assistant can detect and generate substitutes if need be). Reasons are provided for retention for recurring plans.
9. Users can list ingredients they currently have at home to improve meal suggestions and also for consideration for the grocery list generation algorithm.
10. EXTRA: A "I'm on a time/money budget" option can also be cool to add.
